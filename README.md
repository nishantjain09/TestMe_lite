I don't quite work right. Fix me up!

* I need a "Select All" checkbox to toggle all the checkboxes.
* If only some are selected, then the Select All should have that little dash symbol, what's it called?
* When submitting the form, if "Language" is the only thing selected, then we need an error that says "Language cannot be selected alone."
* Submitting successfully will take the user to results.html

extra credit:
* Sort the checkboxes by name.
* Make another column that lists the selected checkboxes.
* Report the selected checkboxes on the results page.
* Use LESS/SASS, etc
* Deploy the project with Grunt to a .tgz
* Serve/Deploy with Yeoman.
* Write as a SPA with AngularJS
* Create a NodeJS server with a reverse proxy and an app server that serves up the checkboxes in JSON format.
* Serve with NodeJS or PHP or LAMP or ?
* Improve the Docs.
* Tell us how to improve the test or specific parts of the test.
* WOW us with your 1337 skilz.

If you can't because you are against pulls or are all out of forks, then you can hand-write your answers on a dead tree and
shove them in an envelope (or email) to your technical contact, manager or recruiter person.
